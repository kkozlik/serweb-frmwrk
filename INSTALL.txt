Configuration
-------------

You should set the environment variable SERWEB_SET_DIRS to the file that 
configure paths to application directories. In appache it could be done by:

SetEnv SERWEB_SET_DIRS "/foo/bar/my_app/config/set_dirs.php"



The directories:

serweb_frmwrk/pages/styles
serweb_frmwrk/pages/js

should be accessible from the web as paths: 

$config->js_src_path."/core"
$config->style_src_path."/core"

This could be achieved either by create symlinks inside $config->js_src_path and
$config->js_src_path directories or by configuring Aliases in apache.
